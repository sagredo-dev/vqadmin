Template codes:
  %-E              Last error
  %-W              Last warning(s)
  %-V              vQadmin version
  %-U              Remote username
  %-G              Remote username's group

Internal template codes:
  $-[0-9,A-Z]      Any internal functions of the CGI may create, and use it's own template codes.
                   Removal of these codes from templates may cause undesired results.

Removal of options (such as 'Create Domain'), is perfectly legal.  It's a good idea not to give anyone
access to these features if you're going to remove them from the templates, because someone with
knowledge of how the CGI functions could post a request to the CGI trying to use the feature.
