Here's a quick explanation of the access lists:

  Format: <user group> <access restrictions> <users>

          user group: Any single alphanumeric word you wish.
                      It's purely for human recognition (except for the "default" group)
          access restrictions: See vqadmin.acl for a list of these and what they mean.
          users: Comma seperated list of users.  When a user logs in via Apache's htaccess
                 system, the CGI will recognize them.  If they don't belong to any of the groups
                 they are set to the default permissions.
