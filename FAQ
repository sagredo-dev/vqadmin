(it was a way of vqadmin saying, I could not find the user, could be either 
the user does not exist, or inappropriate permissions on the acl that makes 
you unable to access vpasswd files). Doing make ---> make install fixes the 
file permissions on the cgi and the acl file. You have to edit the Makefile 
however to reflect your paths, mileage would vary).
